`data_wrangling.R` produces the final dataset used for analyses from raw data from different sources. `202310_bayes_models_v2.R` builds all Bayesian models. `publication_plots.R` makes the data plots in the manuscript. The elements of Fig.1 are produced in `hypothesis_graph.R`. In `grazing_pressure.R` there are calculations on the grazing pressure of rotifers.
